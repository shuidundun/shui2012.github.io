        <h1>Campaign draft</h1>
        <p>My name is Zhang Xuezhao. First of all, I would like to thank the teacher for giving me this opportunity to show myself. My reasons for running for the position are as follows: I can actively and proactively help others; Fourth, I have strong organizational and coordination abilities, clear thinking and accurate expression; At the same time, I also have a wide range of hobbies, such as playing chess, computers, front-end, etc. This position is a bridge between the teacher and the students, and a correspondent between the class and the school. What it represents is not honor, but a responsibility. If I am elected as the team leader, I will be a good bridge between the teacher and the students. I will be more strict with myself, set a good example, study hard, constantly improve myself, and strive to make progress and improvement in all aspects. Of course, I also have many shortcomings. Please supervise and criticize me, teacher and classmates.</p>
        <p>Thank you all</p>
